<h1>Hi</h1>
<h2>I'm joseph</h2>
<p>Q: But what do your friends call you?</p>
<div class="answer">
    <h2>joseph</h2>
</div>

<p>Q: What are you currently doing with your life?</p>

<div class="answer">
    <ul>
        <li>I'm getting a double degree in Computer Science and Linguistics</li>
        <li>I'm taking CMSC351 (help it hurts)</li>
        <li>I've been on the hunt for an internship but no dice so far :(</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>Q: Those are pretty different fields. What's that like?</p>

<div class="answer">
    <b> Both fields are really interesting and have more overlap than you might think.
        <ol>
            <li>For example, the field of syntax is in large part concerned with the composition of tree structures that represent grammatical structures of sentences</li>
            <li>Semantics uses a lot of propositional logic, so what I learned in discrete math was extremely helpful in understanding the basics of the field </li>
            <li>There are intersections between the two fields in professionally: specifically Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. Might be a bit mathy for me though.</li>
        </ol>
    </b>
</div>

<p>Q: What about after college?</p>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Endgame I want to be working outside the US, but I'll probably work at a company within the US at first to get experience</li>
        <li>I sincerely wouldn't mind staying a code boy for OK wages if I could have good work-life balance. That's my #1 priority</li>
        <li>Not really feeling all the companies working with the department of defense around here so I'll probably end up working in a different area to start</li>
